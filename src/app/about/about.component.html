                    My name is Said Nouiri, and I enjoy <span class="default-highlight">creating efficient DevOps

                <p class="default-p">
                    I am a DevOps Engineer from Tunisia. Arabic is my native language, and I am proficient in both
                    French and English.
                </p>
                <p class="default-p">My journey in technology began with my studies in <span
                        class="default-highlight">Embedded Systems</span>,
                    where I worked on innovative projects like developing <span class="default-highlight">smart glasses
                        for the visually impaired</span>
                    and creating <span class="default-highlight">intelligent refrigeration systems</span>. These
                    experiences taught me the importance of
                    <span class="default-highlight">combining hardware and software solutions</span> to solve real-world
                    problems.

                    I've had the chance to work with a comprehensive stack of <span class="default-highlight">DevOps

                    <span class="default-highlight">monitoring</span>. My technical journey includes implementing
                    <span class="default-highlight">CI/CD pipelines</span> with GitLab, containerizing applications with
                    <span class="default-highlight">Docker</span>, and orchestrating containers with <span
